# Description

My motivation behind this project was to get more familiar with backend work by creating a functional Social Media backend. 

Through this I was able to become more familiar with get, post, delete and post requests in a variety of scenarios:

- Adding, removing, altering users. 
- Tracking posts, allowing users to add, remove, and update posts.
- Allowing users to react to posts and add/remove friends. 

This project helped me learn a lot when it comes to creating and utilizing models and controllers which would allow the user to easily add, remove and update aspects within their social media experience.
